# Green Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
### My client Steve is happy with the workbook I prepared for him. He can analyze an entire dataset with a click of a button. He is wanting to do some more research for his parents.
He is wanting to expand the dataset exponentially to include the entire stock market over the last few years. The previous code I wrote him worked for a few stocks but it might not 
work well for thousands of stocks or take too long to tally. I will need to find a way to refactor my existing code to work through the dataset quickly but efficiently.
