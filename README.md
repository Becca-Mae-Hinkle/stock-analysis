# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
My client Steve is happy with the workbook I prepared for him. He can analyze an entire dataset with a click of a button. He is wanting to do some more research for his parents.
He is wanting to expand the dataset exponentially to include the entire stock market over the last few years. The previous code I wrote him worked for a few stocks but it might not work well for thousands of stocks. We need to find a way to make this new workbook just as seamless as the first one I did for him. I will need to find a way to refactor my existing code to work through the dataset quickly but efficiently. To make sure I will get the results I am looking for, I will be comparing the time each workbook takes to finish.
# Results
## Refactoring the Code
I made changes to the original code to be more efficient. I created 3 new arrays: 
- tickerVolumes(12) to hold voulume
- tickerStartingPrices(12) - to hold the starting price
- tickerEndingPrices(12) - to hold the ending price

The tickers array I created in the original workbook established a ticker symbol that was called on in each stock. When I refactored the tickers array I was able to store performance data for each stock when a for loop runs an analysis on them.
The tickerIndex variable I created was able to match the 3 performance arrays so I can use nested for loops and variable to loop through the data and complete the analysis. This function allows me to get the results I want.

See the Refactored and Original coding below.
