# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
### My client Steve is happy with the workbook I prepared for him. He can analyze an entire dataset with a click of a button. He is wanting to do some more research for his parents.
He is wanting to expand the dataset exponentially to include the entire stock market over the last few years. The previous code I wrote him worked for a few stocks but it might not work well for thousands of stocks. We need to find a way to make this new workbook just as seamless as the first one I did for him. I will need to find a way to refactor my existing code to work through the dataset quickly but efficiently. To make sure I will get the results I am looking for, I will be comparing the time each workbook takes to finish.
